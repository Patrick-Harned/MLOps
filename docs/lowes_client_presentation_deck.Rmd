#knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.hieght = 50)
```

## Problem Statement

**Problem**:   
How to automatically trigger the deployment and accuracy monitoring of ML models with each commit to a project git repository?

**Solution Business Value:**  
- Remove time and expertise intensive steps to deploy and test models during development.   
- Prevent harm to your ML based workload from decreased accuracy over time due to data distribution shift.


## Cloud Pak for Data Product Overview

- What is Watson Machine Learning?
  - A tool for deploying versioned machine learning models as REST APIs.
- What is Watson Openscale?
  - A tool that monitors the accuracy and fairness of machine learning models overtime with alerts and model explainability tooling.
