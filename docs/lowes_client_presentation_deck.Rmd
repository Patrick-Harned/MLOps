## Streamlining the AI Lifecycle {.codefont}

**Problem**:   
How to automate the deployment and risk management of version-controlled ML models ?

**Solution**:  
CDI pipelines integrating with Watson Machine Learning and Watson Openscale on Cloud Pak for Data

**Solution Business Value:**  
- Streamline deployment of ML models, reduce time to market; accelerate AI Lifecycle.   
- Detect and remedy poor performing algorithms quickly by integrating risk management tooling into CDI Pipeline for ML models;.


## Cloud Pak for Data Product Overview

- Watson Machine Learning
  - Deploy and manage machine learning models.
- Watson Openscale
  - Monitor performance of deployed machine learning models; Validate and test models to mitigate operational risk.
- CPDCTL
  - Command line tool for orchestrating Cloud Pak for Data workflows.
- Jenkins
  - Automation tool to build, test and deploy software.

```{r, out.width = 600, out.hieght = 600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../plot.png"  )
```



## Pipeline Steps 

1. Store model binary in the WML repository
2. Deploy the model as a REST API in Watson Machine Learning
3. Subscribe the model to  Watson Openscale
4. Score and validate model performance in Watson Openscale
